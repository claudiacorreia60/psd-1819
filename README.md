# Loan Intermediation Service

This service has two different types of users, namely companies, which request loans, and investors, who provide financing. Companies can hold auctions/issues at a fixed rate, while investors can bid/subscribe for these shares. The existence of real-time notifications is useful to inform clients and investors about events. In addition to this, there is a directory from which information about existing companies and their stock histories can be consulted, as well as the auctions/issues that are taking place in real time.
